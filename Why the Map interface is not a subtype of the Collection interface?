Because Maps work with key/value pairs, while the other collections work with just values.
Both key and values are objects. The key must be unique but the values can be duplicate.
These are commonly used methods defined by Map interface

boolean containsKey(Object k): returns true if map contain k as key. Otherwise false.
Object get(Object k) : returns values associated with the key k.
Object put(Object k, Object v) : stores an entry in map.
Object putAll(Map m) : put all entries from m in this map.
Set keySet() : returns Set that contains the key in a map.
Set entrySet() : returns Set that contains the entries in a map.
