Platform Independent is one of the java features that enables java program to run anywhere anytime.
At first, Java compiler (Javac) convert Java classes (with .java extension) to Bytecode that is .class file.
The Bytecode has supported in all operating systems (like Mac, Windows, and Linux).
JVM or Java Virtual Machine is then responsible for executing code line-by-line.(which converts byte code to machinde code)
 In JVM, three stage performed:
◼ Class Loader - loads classes to heap memory
◼ Bytecode Verified -checks if theres any issue
◼ Java-In-Time Compiler 
In which If our Code doesn't have any issue, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler converts it to Native Machine code.
