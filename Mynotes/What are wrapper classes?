It basically helps to convert primitive to object and object to primitive
Example:
int a= 6;
Integer  i = integer.valueOf(a);
Here a is variable i.e primitive
And i is object 

Here we converted primitive to object

Example 2 
String str=''; this can be said as object S is capital
Int x;
x = Integer.parseInt(str)

x primitive variable

str is object 
Converts object to primitive

Or Integer a = new Integere() //object
int b = a.intValue() ; b is primitive variable

1st one is said to be auto boxing
Automatic conversion of P to O 
int b;
Integer a = b;

Unboxing again vice versa automatic
Object to primitive


int b = a;
